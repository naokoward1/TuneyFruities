The game "Tuney Fruities" is an audio game.
There are two modes of interactivity: free play, and game mode.

Keyboard and mouse interactivity
Users press keys 'd', 'f', 'j', and 'k' to output 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'g', respectively.
The corresponding fruit character is also animated as a result of these key inputs.
'm' mutes and unmutes during game mode. 
'a' skips to the end during game mode. 
'q' returns to the start screen for all screens.
Various buttons are included to move between screens.

GUI systems
There is a start screen, an options screen, a game mode screen, and a free play screen. 

Class objects with animation hierarchies
The note class has animation hierarchy. As the whole system translates across the screen,
the music note itself pulses, becoming bigger and smaller.

Data input/output
Game mode takes in user input to display the notes in concord with the Mii song.

Sound
Sound is outputted during the game mode as players try to click keys in time with the Mii song.
In addition, 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'g' are outputted, corresponding with the keys pressed.
'm' mutes and unmutes during game mode.

Waleed did the data input/output and implemented game mode.
Vanessa drew all the graphics and made it look cohesive.
Susan made the GUI systems and wrote the note class. 

We were challenged in the hardware. We had planned on using a Featherboard instead of using
keyboard input, but are still working on this aspect of the project.
